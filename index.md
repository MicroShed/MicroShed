## About

MicroShed Testing offers a fast and simple way of writing and running true-to-production integration
tests for Java microservice applications. MicroShed Testing exercises your containerized application
from outside the container so you are testing the exact same image that runs in production.

MicroShed Testing aims to:
1. be easy to get started with
1. work with any JavaEE or MicroProfile runtime
1. provide true-to-production tests
